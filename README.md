### How to run

Installing dependencies:

# poetry appdata (window) directory
poetry install
```

Run the project:
- you can pick any python source file to run using `poetry run`

e.g: 
```sh
# poetry will automatically activate the project env that was previously created from `poetry install`
poetry run test
